longhorn
========

A microservice that does micro things.

## Building

`make`

## Running

You need to be running RancherOS v0.4.4 (all kernel patches are not yet fully upstreamed).
Also ensure that TCMU is enabled:

    modprobe target_core_user
    mount -t configfs none /sys/kernel/config

Then run

    ./bin/longhorn replica --size 10g /opt/volume
    ./bin/longhorn replica --size 10g --listen localhost:9505 /opt/volume2
    ./bin/longhorn controller --frontend tcmu --replica tcp://localhost:9502 --replica tcp://localhost:9505 vol-name

That will create the device `/dev/longhorn/vol-name`

## Ports

Each replica uses three consequetive ports.  By default they are 9502, 9503, and 9504.  They are used for
controll channel, data channel, and sync communication respectively.

## CLI

List replicas

    longhorn ls

Remove replica

    longhorn rm tcp://localhost:9502

Add replica

    longhorn add tcp://localhost:9502
